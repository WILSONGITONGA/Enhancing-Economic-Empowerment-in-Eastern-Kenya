## Wilson's Role.
I was contracted by EMAC to lead data collection for the Economic Empowerment and Access to Resources (EEAR) project in Eastern Kenya. My main task was to use the KOBO Collect app to create a detailed questionnaire for survey to identify key economic players in the area. With my background in data analysis, I designed easy-to-understand Questionnaire  to gather important information from local economic actors and beneficiaries. I also trained the data collectors to effectively use the app and provided ongoing support during the collection process. By using KOBO Collect, I ensured real-time data entry, allowing EMAC to quickly analyze the information and create a resource directory. 
## Project Description.
The EEAR project, initiated by EMAC, seeks to tackle the economic challenges faced by marginalized communities in Eastern Kenya. With a growing desire among beneficiaries to start their own businesses, they often struggle due to a rapidly changing economy. EMAC aims to provide essential resources and information to help these individuals succeed. The project will map economic actors in the region and create a directory that will be shared through an E-Newsletter and web blog, connecting beneficiaries with the support and resources they need.
## Project Problem Statement.
Marginalized populations in Eastern Kenya encounter significant hurdles to economic empowerment, primarily due to a lack of access to essential resources and information for starting income-generating activities. Despite their interest in entrepreneurship, they face challenges like an unstable economic environment, limited funding, and few connections to potential supporters. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive understanding of the local economic landscape, including key economic actors and available resources. Currently, beneficiaries lack a centralized source of this information, making it difficult for them to seize economic opportunities. EMAC recognizes the need to create a directory of economic actors to empower these communities and enhance their access to development financing.
## Project Objectives.
1.	**Identify Economic Actors:** Conduct surveys to find key economic players in Eastern Kenya who can support beneficiaries.
2.	**Create a Comprehensive Directory:** Develop a detailed directory of these economic actors, including their expertise and resources.
3.	**Enhance Accessibility:** Improve access to economic financing and resources for marginalized populations.
4.	**Strengthen Capacity:** Train data collectors to ensure accurate data gathering.
5.	**Utilize Technology:** Use KOBO Collect to streamline data collection and analysis.
## Scope of the Project.
- **Geographical Area:** Targeting marginalized communities in Eastern Kenya.
- **Stakeholder Involvement:** Engaging local economic actors, community leaders, and beneficiaries throughout the project.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Implementing a structured process for data collection and analysis.
- **Information Dissemination:** Publishing an E-Newsletter and web blog to share findings with stakeholders.
## Aim of the Project.
The main goal of the EEAR project is to improve access to economic development financing for marginalized communities in Eastern Kenya. By creating a well-researched directory of economic actors, the project will empower beneficiaries with the information and connections they need to pursue their income-generating initiatives.
## Steps Utilized to Undertake the Project.
1.	**Survey Design:** Tailor questionnaires to gather relevant data.
2.	**Data Collector Training:** Train data collectors to ensure effective data gathering.
3.	**Data Collection:** Use KOBO Collect for efficient data gathering in the field.
4.	**Data Cleaning and Analysis:** Clean and analyze the collected data for meaningful insights.
5.	**Reporting and Feedback:** I summarized findings and recommendations based on the collected data.
6.	**Directory Development:** Compiled the data into a structured directory of economic actors.
7.	**E-Newsletter and Web Blog Creation:** Design and publish these platforms to disseminate findings.
8.	**Distribution:** Share the E-Newsletter and directory widely with beneficiaries and stakeholders.
## Impacts of the Project.
- **Economic Empowerment:** Greater access to resources will help beneficiaries establish income-generating activities, improving their livelihoods
- **Networking Opportunities:** The project will create connections between marginalized populations and economic actors, fostering a supportive environment for entrepreneurship.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Beneficiaries will be better equipped to make informed choices about their economic ventures due to the comprehensive data provided.
## Findings:
- There is a significant gap in access to economic resources for marginalized populations.
- Beneficiaries want to start businesses but lack the necessary support.
- Economic actors often do not understand the needs of marginalized communities.
## Recommendations:
1.	**Continued Engagement:** Foster ongoing relationships between economic actors and beneficiaries.
2.	**Regular Updates:** Keep the directory current to reflect changes in the economic landscape.
3.	**Workshops and Training:** Organize sessions to teach beneficiaries how to effectively use the directory and apply for financial support from the identified economic actors.
4.	**Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a system for continuous improvement based on user experiences.

By supporting the EEAR project, donors and employers can play a crucial role in transforming the economic landscape for marginalized communities in Eastern Kenya, promoting sustainable development and empowering people to thrive.
